# Open Trust Group

This is an open source software community and focus on trusted OS development.

The first project is to develop an open source TEE called Gz-TEE, just like [OP-TEE](https://github.com/OP-TEE) and [Trusty TEE](https://source.android.com/security/trusty/). OP-TEE is a good reference design for TEE OS developers and it is compliant with standard GlobalPlatform TEE APIs. As for Trusty TEE, it's IPC (Inter Processor/Process Communication) mechanism is very flexible and support asynchrononus communication. Both of them all have very good software quality.
